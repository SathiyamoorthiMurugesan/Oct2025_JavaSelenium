Day 2 (08/10/2024)

Taluk office - class
rooms - methods/functions

Reception related things(table, phone, receptionist, computer) - static - belongs to the class

Paper, pen, water can, water bottle, table, chairs, chalan - anyone can access - public
Receptionist mobile, person's mobile/money/bike - private
Documents, rooms  - protected
People - default

Access Modifier - public, private, protected and default

Variables
    10 people/chair/table or 20 people/chair/table or 5 people/chair/table
	- (10, 20 and 5)- variable values
	- people/chair/table - type- datatype
	- red table, red chairs or white chairs - naming - variable name

	chair redColor = 30;  --camel case format - myNameIsSathya - mynameissathya
	chair - datatype
	red - variable name 
	30 - variable value 
public chair red = 20;
private chair red = 2; 

VARIABLE COMMON SYNTAX 
	accessModifer datatype variableName = variableValue;


Method - room- specific work
	* Whatever happens inside is not visible to outside or other methods/rooms
	* We can bring things from reception/hall to a method
	* But we can not bring a thing from method/room to outside. In order to do that, we need to follow a process
		- RETURN TYPE
	* Most of the time method wont give us anything - VOID 

METHOD COMMON SYNTAX 
	- AccessModifer returnType methodName() { }
	- public/private/protected void incomeTaxCertificateProcess() {
		
		}
	-  void incomeTaxCertificateProcess() {
		
		}

Taluk office - Class
	- It does a set of works
	- Methods are written inside a class

CLASS COMMON SYNTAX 
	- AccessModifier class(keyword) ClassName { }
	- public class TalukOffice {

		}
	
public class TalukOffice {

	- default void washRoom() {
	
		}
		
	- void washRoom1() {
	
		}

public chair red = 20;
private chair red = 2; 
	
}

* incomeTaxCertificateProcess - camelCase
	- class names should start with CAPITAL LETTER and followed by camelCase
	- method/variable names should start with SMALL LETTER and followed by camelCase
	- all the java keywords starts with SMALL LETTER such as class, access modifiers(e.g:public), void etc.


People administration - package

We need someone or some office to create rules so that by using that every taluk office will work
For that, in Java, we use Interface 

We create rules in interface

COMMON SYNTAX FOR INTERFACE 
	- AccessModifier interface(Java keyword) InterfaceName { }

Day 4 (10/10/2024)

* Class - It does a set of work. It consist of variables and methods. Each work would be done by methods. 

* Methods - It does specific job. It always written inside a class/interface

* Variable - it can have type(Data type) and posses a number or name;
			variables can have different access - access Modifier
			
* Access Modifier - defines where we can use a variable/method/class

* Interface - It contains rules most of the time. Sometimes it does some work too(means method).
			Interface is always followed by class/classes. 
			When class follows interface, class should do the rule written in the interfacebject

* package - contains class/classes/interface/interfaces/file/files/folder/folders

* Project - consist of package/packages/file/files/folder/folders/source(src)folder


	* src/main/java
	* src/main/resources
src/main - development related codes and its supporting files
		
	* src/test/java
	* src/test/resources
src/test - test case or testing related codes and its supporting files

	


* static - static means belongs to the class. If govt hospital is class, then hospital receptionist is a static member of that class. 
                 We can not seperate them. variables and methods can be static
			within a class - static can be used anywhere directly in the same (in a static method or in non-static method)
			Outside class - static can be used but alone with class name. (in a static method or in non-static method)

* Object (Creation or instantiation or initiation)  - E.g: Medical camp; 
			We create Object only for classes; Whenever we create object we copy whatever the class contains(except static)
			means, only non-static is copied
			Through object we can not call static things.

* Constructor - Object creation happens with the help of constructor
				constructor is available in different kind
				1. without any money/document
				2. only with money
				3. only with document
				4. with both money and document

Day 5 (14/10/2024)

*****https://www.shellhacks.com/git-create-new-branch/****

Git basics

Git alternative tool - bitBucket, Azure, AWS

* helps to work on a same file by multiple person. 
* SCM - Source code management 

Original project is in our system, we use Eclipse to view and edit the project in easy manner

File Explorer view of our project - Local
Git view of our project - Remote 

Git Repository - Repo- Remote - Remote project

1) Create a Java project 
2) Add some packages and classes and some files 
3) In github.com, create a repository
4) In File explorer, go to your Java project 
5) From there open git bash andd type below commands
	* git init -- it will create a local git with master branch
	* git add .
	* git commit -m "some messages"
	* git remote add origin "repository's SSH path" - we are introducing online repository to local git 
	* git push origin master
	* git status
	* git config --global user.email "";
	* git config --global user.name "";
	
Need to add ssh token of your Eclipse into your Github
To generate the ssh key in Eclipse 
	Go to window -> preferences -> search for SSH
	click SSH2
	Go to keyManagement
	generate RSA token 
	save it in the default path (which would be .ssh folder in your system)
	Open the .ssh folder 
	open the pub file in notepad 
	copy  the ssh-rsa entire string
Go to gihub
	Your profile -> Settings -> SSH settings ->
	click Add new key
	Give title and paste the key
	save it
	
Now you can push your files easily 
	
	
**********************************************************
Day 6 (15/10/2024)

Maven - Dependencies management tool

other such tools - Gradle, ant

	* Difficulties in adding a .jar file into our project, downloading the dependencies or upgrade/degrading it
	* .M2 folder stores the dependencies added in pom.xml file
	* Maven projects gives us a proper project structure
	
resolution:-
	* Instead of Java project, create a maven project
	* All maven project consist pom.xml file
	* In pom.xml file, we add the required dependencies
		* groupId
		* artifactId
		* version
		* scope (optional)
	* Eg:-
		OnePlus - GroupID 
		Mobile - ArtifactID
		OnePlus11R - Version
	* Eg:-
		GroupID - selenium.org
		ArtifactID - selenium-java
		version - 4.20.1
		
* Home work
	* Create Maven project
	* push to git repo using git bash
	* delete project from your system
	* By using eclipse import the project directly from git(without RSA)
	* Add RSA and then import directly from git
	* Download the project from 
		* https://github.com/SathiyamoorthiMurugesan/ABC
		* Import this project into eclipse
		

1. Create a local project (add all the required files)
2. In github, create a repo
3. Open git bash from your project location
4. git init 
5. git add .
6. git commit  -m "message"
7. git remote add origin "git repo link"
8. git push -u origin master

Day 8 (17/10/2024)

Class - important thing, through which we perform some task. Class may contains methods and variables

Method1 - A work - 10 lines of codes
Method2 - B work - 10 lines of codes
Method3 - C work ( A work + some other work = method1 + some other work)
				 (	
No duplicate codes
redundant - repeatable 
reuse
No. of line will reduce 

&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

Variables

Variables - shape and count/name
shape - datatype 



Syntax:-
	AccessModifier datatype variableName = variableValue
	public int a = 10;
	private String b = "xyz";
	
	people red = 10;
	people orange = "Sathya";
	
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

Datatype: Its a classification of a data, which tells the compiler or interpreter 
about how the programmer intends to use the data.

Syntax of variables
AccessModifier datatype variableName = variableValue

1) Primitive
	a) boolean - yes or no OR true or false 
		* boolean aa = true; --> Variable declared and initialized
		* boolean ab;  --> Variable declared but not initiated.
			- default value will be assigned to ab is "false";
		* boolean cc;
			cc = true;
	
	b) Textual 
		1) char - a, b, c, A, B
			* char ba = 'a';
			* char bb = '1';
			* default value of char is null;
		2) byte - 
			byte x = 10;
	c) numeric 
		1) int 
			* int cc = 10;
			* default value = 0;
		2) short
			* short dd = 20;
			* default value = 0;
		3) double
			* double ee = 30d;
			* default value = 0;
		4) long
			* long ff = 20l;
			* default value = 0;
		5) float
			* float gg = 2.5f;
			* default value = 0;
			
Data Type	Description
byte	Stores whole numbers from -128 to 127
short	Stores whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767
int		Stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
long	Stores whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
float	Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits
double	Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 15 to 16 decimal digits
boolean	Stores true or false values
char	Stores a single character/letter or ASCII values

2) Non Primitive
	d) String - In java, String is a Non-Primitive data type but at the same time its a Class.
		* String hh = "aA10@";
		* String ii = "In java, String is a Non-Primitive data type but at the same time its a Class.";
		* String jj = "null";
		* default = null;
	e) array
	
int a; - declare
a = 10; - define/initiate/assign
int a = 10 - declare and initiate

int a = 10;
default - access modifier
int - data type( primitive --> numeric)
a - variable/variableName;
10 - value posses by the variable/ value pointed by the variable

If you want 10, you need to call 'a' only.

Day 9 (18/10/2024)

How to create a class, nested classes with different access modifiers
How to create a interface, nested interfaces with different access modifiers
How to create non-static methods and static methods 
How to create variables 

********************************************************************

Different variables
How to create/call variables inside a method

Variables - Its a memory location that can hold values of a specific datatype.

Types of variables 
1. Local variable - 
	* Datatype declared/initiated within a method/constructor, for, if    -- block/body ({...})
	* scope of local variable is only within the block in which the variable is declared
	* local variables can not be static
	{
	int a = 10;
	char c;
	c = '2';
	String sathya = "10";
	static int b = 10; -- we can not create like this.
	}
	
2. Instance variable/class variable/non-static variable
	* Declared within a class but outside of a block ({...})
	* Non- static variables
	* To access instance variables, we need to create object for that class
	
	classA {
	int a = 10; //class level non static variable
	String sathya = "10"; //class level non static variable
	
	method1() {
	int  aa = 10; // local variable
	
	sysout(sathya); // we can not use a non static like this. we need to create object
	// it should be written as 
	ClassA obj = new ClassA(); //object creation
	sysout(obj.a);
	}
	
	}
	
	
3. static variable
	* Declared within a class but outside of a block with "static" keyword
	* static keyword is used with variables and methods
	* To access this variable, dont need to create an object
	* within a class - static can be used anywhere directly (in a static method or in non-static method)
	* Outside class - static can be used but along with class name. (in a static method or in non-static method)
	
	static int a = 10;
	static String sathya = "10";
	public static int c = 200;
	
ClassA (TalukOffice) {

static int receptionist = 10;

method1() {
	print (receptionist);
}

}


ClassB (Govt hospital) {

method2() {
print (ClassA.receptionist);
//print (TalukOffice.receptionist)
}

**************************************************************************

*********Calling methods **********

A work - method1(); -- 100 lines of codes

B work - method2(); -- 100 lines of codes

C work - method3(); -- 250 lines of code 
	method3() is method1() + method2() + some other work

- Reuse of methods 
- duplicates and redundant codes - remove

AS OF NOW, WE HAVE SEEN TWO KIND OF METHODS
1. static methods 
2. non-static methods

&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

//	We can create object of a class in another class 
//		* (eg: creating object for Class22 inside of CallingMethods1)
	
//	For reference:

Access Modifier
	* It defines where and who can use a method/variable/class
	1) default
	2) private
	3) protected
	4) public 
	
	Syntax = accessModifier dataType variableName/variable = variableValue (Could be local variable or non-static variable)
		   = static accessModifier dataType variableName/variable = variableValue (class level variable or static variable)
		   
	int a = 10; - default (no need to mention "default" word

JVM - Java Virtual Machine 
* This can not be seen
* it starts the execution(creates Runtime Environment)
* It first checks for main method and executes the codes inside the main method
* It creates the code flow, in java the flow is called "Thread"  - "main Thread"
* JVM provides run time environment in which Java byte codes can be executed
* loads code| verifies code| execute code| provides run time environment

JRE - Java Runtime Environment
* Physically exist
* Contains JVM and set of libraries
* JVM uses these libraries to execute the codes

JDK - Java Developement kit
* It contains JVM, set of libraries and dev tools (JRE + dev tools)
* Used to develop and execute the codes
* Dev tools + debugger + compiler + java doc

	2. Method name should same
	3. No. of parameter, type of parameter and order of parameter


2. Overriding - Runtime polymorphism
	1. Between two classes 
		* Those two classes should be in a relationship (Parent and child) - Inheritance
	2. method name should be same
	3. method parameters also should be same
	4. Object creation plays an important role

4) during obj creation constructor call would happen
5) Constructor can not be static 
6) Cons. is private, we can not create obj of class in other classes
7) We can parameterize constructor
8) inside constructor we can call methods and create variables
9) within a class, we can use this() to call one cons. from other
10) every child class cons. has super() as a first line of code, in order to call the parent default cons.
11) We can create a final variable without initiating but we need to initialize in all the constructors
12) When default cons. is implicitly present and we create a parameterized cons., then default cons. will vanish.

Create a excel with  headers and rows 
Store the headers and given row's values in a map.

Count repeated letters/words in a word/sentence respectively. 
here also you can use map.

a = 2;
b = 1

Sathiyamoorthi - count no. of letters in this word
Pseudocode 
	* seperate each letters in a sentence by using split("") or charAt(index) or toCharArray();
	* now we have a String or char array.
	* declare a an arraylist
	* use two for loops 
	* in parent for loop initalise a variable count = 1;
	* if the letter is not present inside the ArrayList, then only, we will go through child for loop
	* within child for loop, you have to use if condition to check array[i] == array[j]
	* When the above if condition passes
		* increase the count;
	* once you check the each letter,  within parent for loop, add that letter a[i] to an ArrayList

* Where do we need the automation most? Regression.

🧪 Types of Functional Testing:
	Type									Description
Unit Testing					Tests individual functions or methods (often by developers).
Smoke Testing					Basic checks to verify the application is stable.
Sanity Testing					Quick test to check specific functionality after changes.
Regression Testing				Ensures new changes haven't affected existing features.
Integration Testing				Verifies interaction between modules or components.
System Testing					End-to-end testing of the entire application.
User Acceptance Testing (UAT)	Performed by end users to validate business functionality.

Selenium Basics

Why we need automation - saves Time and Man power
Benefits

Things to be considered before starting web automation.

Different Automation tools and Editor
Automation tools 
	* Selenium
	* UFT (QTP)
	* PlayWrite
	* RPA - Robotic process automation
	
Programming language
	* Java
	* Python
	* .Net
	* Ruby

	* .Net
	
Back End
	* Java/JavaScript/Angular/.Net
	* Database management
	* Cloud
	* Source Code Management tools (SCM) - Git, Bit Bucket, AWS, Azure
	
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

* In manual testing, we do the testing - (we are the tester)
* In Automation, who would work as a tester - WebDriver (it is the automation tester)


What is WebDriver 
* WebDriver - interface
* WebDriver is nothing but us(TESTERs).
* The main properties of a browser are created as methods inside WebDriver interface

* Why WebDriver is created as a interface?

* WebDriver interface methods 
	* Important concepts  
		* return type of findElement(By by) and findElments(By by) and explain why?
		* What is sessionId 
		* What is windowHandle 
		* return type of windowHandle() windowHandles() and explain why?

Selenium Hierarchy
	* SearchContext - interface
	* WebDriver - interface (Basic actions we do on the Browser are written in this interface)
	* RemoteWebDriver - Class
	* ChromeDriver, EdgeDriver, FirefoxDriver, SafariDriver - Class
	
interface SearchContext {
}

interface WebDriver extends SearchContext {

}

class RemoteWebDriver implements WebDriver {

}

class ChromeDriver extends RemoteWebDriver {

}
	
What is the significance of Remote WebDriver?
What is the difference between Chrome Browser and ChromeDriver (likewise other browsers) - We will see it later


************************************************************************************
Day 53 (19/05/2024)

What is WebElement
	* Whatever element you see on a web page is called WebElement
	* It is a interface which follows SearchContext (In Java)

How do you find or interact with a WebElement:

	* WebElements in a web page are represented by HTML tags
	  

	What is DOM in browser
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. 
It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. 
Essentially, the DOM provides a structured representation of the document (as a tree of objects), 
and it defines a way that the structure can be accessed from programs 
so that they can change the document's content, structure, and style.

How do you open the DOM of a web page
	* DOM (right click on a page and inspect or F12 or Ctrl+Shift + I)
	
	* diff types of tags
		* html
		* head
		* body
		* header
		* input
		* div
		* ul
			* li
		* a 
		* svg
		* select (drop down)
			* option
		* frame or iframe (small html)
		* table
			* tr

HTML tag structures and attributes

* attributes
	whatever key value pair we see inside any tag is called attributes
	
	<div> - start tag
	
	</div> - end tag
	
	<div key1 = "val1" key2 = "val2" > - start tag
	"text" 
	</div>
	
	where
	div - tagName
	key1, key2 - attributes
	val1, val2 - attribute's value
	"text" - tag's display name

How to find element in a page 

<html>

ancestor(div)
  parent(div)
	parent(ul)
		child(li)
			child(select)
		child(ul)
			child(li)
			child(li)
	parent(ul)

	* /html/body/nav/div/div/ul[1]/li[1]/span

	* If there is a change in UI, the above order will change and we can not find our desired element 
		using the above xpath. 
	* So using this xpath is  NOT RECOMMENDED.
	
2) Relative xpath

Syntax
//tagName[@attributeName = 'value']OR -- Most preferred
//*[@attributeName = 'value'] OR 
//tagName[@attributeName = "value"] 

String xpath = "//tagName[@attributeName = \"value\"]"

************************************************************************************
Day 55 (21/05/2024)

Relative xpath 

basic and simple xpath
and
or
you can also use * instead of tagName
text()
contains with text(), value
contains with @attribute, value
//following::tagName
//preceding::tagName
//ancestor::tagName
//parent::tagName
//child::tagName
//following-sibling::tagName
//preceding-sibling::tagName
We can use numbers along with xpath 

by writing single xpath, you can access multiple elements too (eg: drop down values or menu values)


&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

//tagName[@attribute = 'value']//following::tagName

When element is not found - we get elementNotFoundException

Why element is not found, because we wrongly identified the element
1) spelling mistake
2) flow mistake
3) xpath wrong
4) timing - synchronization between code run and web page loading

StaleElementException
	* Element is available in DOM but not visible in UI

Day 56 (23/05/2024)

How do you open a web site in your system? 

Chrome browser and ChromeDriver difference.

Chrome Browser
What it is: Google Chrome is a web browser used by people to browse websites.

Purpose: It is designed for human interaction, displaying websites, running web apps, and accessing online content.

ChromeDriver
What it is: ChromeDriver is a separate executable that WebDriver (from Selenium, for example) uses to control the Chrome browser.

Purpose: It acts as a bridge between test scripts and the Chrome browser.

Compatibility issue. 

To manage compatibility issue, we have 
WebDriverManager - we will see it later 

WebDriverManager automates all of this. It:

Downloads the appropriate driver version.

Sets the path automatically.

Keeps drivers up to date.

Window Handle in Selenium

session id - driver 
window handle - id unique is for each window opened during above session. its never going to be a duplicate value.

By using a driver's, if we open one or more browser window,
	each window will be assigned with a ID and its called window handle. 
	
Where is the driver's "focus" would be.

String getWindowHandle();// for a single window
Set<string> getWindowHandles(); // for multiple windows

switching to a newly opened window when only one new window is opened.

Day 57 (24/05/2024)

1) How to add Selenium to our project
	* as a dependency
	* https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.seleniumhq.selenium/selenium-java
	* Add dependency to your project's pom.xml (learn and know how the dependency is added to your project)
	* Update the maven project
	* confirm the dependency is visible on the project under Maven dependencies
	
2) Writing a first Selenium code 
	* How do you launch the Amazon application in Chrome browser? 
	* Manually
		* Run chrome.exe file by the tester or user
		* Enter the url
	* Through Automation 
		* ChromeDriver.exe need to be run by WebDriver
		* How do WebDriver know where is my ChromeDriver.exe?
			* We need to give the location of ChromeDriver.exe file to the WebDriver 
			* We need to download it and add it in your project
		* What is the check here? 
			* Your installed Chrome browser version should be aligned with ChromeDriver version
			* Else you will get compatibility issue.
				
			

&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

Why do we create object as below

WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();  //here Overriding concept will be applied. 
When we call, WebDriver methods will show, but while  we run methods from ChromeDriver or its parent class method will run.

why not 

ChromeDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();


System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "C:\\Users\\LENOVO\\git\\SaraswathyJavaProject\\drivers\\chromedriver_107.exe");
ChromeDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();


But we do not need to create object like above.
Because it will cause a problem when we need to open different browser in single driver instance

To avoid this we keep WebDriver interface as reference for object

WebDriver interface and ChromeDriver/FirefoxDriver/SafariDriver/EdgeDriver are connected through RemoteWebDriver class

All the methods in WebDriver interface are implemented in RemoteWebDriver.

All browser drivers are extended to RemoteWebDriver

WebDriver driver; 
driver = new ChromeDriver();
driver = new FirefoxDriver();

{ 

ChromeDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();

code

driver = new EdgeDriver();

EdgeDriver driver1 = new EdgeDriver();

WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();

driver = new EdgeDriver();
driver = new FireDriver();

WebDriver methods - practice



public interface WebDriver  {
Options manage();
}

interface Options {

    void addCookie(Cookie cookie);
    void deleteCookieNamed(String name);
    void deleteCookie(Cookie cookie);
    void deleteAllCookies();
    Set<Cookie> getCookies();
    @Nullable Cookie getCookieNamed(String name);
    Timeouts timeouts();
    Window window();
}

interface Window {
    Dimension getSize();
    void setSize(Dimension targetSize);
    Point getPosition();
    void setPosition(Point targetPosition);
    void maximize();
    void minimize();
    void fullscreen();
}

interface Timeouts {
  default Timeouts implicitlyWait(Duration duration) {
  }
 
 
implicitlyWait - in Selenium
	* In Selenium, implicitlyWait() is used to tell WebDriver to wait for a certain amount of time 
	when trying to find an element if it is not immediately available.
	
*****************************************************************************

Day 58 (25/05/2024)	
	
Locators in Selenium 

 We find elements in a page using locators 
  
1) id
2) name
3) className
4) tagName
5) linkText
6) partialLinkText
7) xpath
8) css

Locators in selenium - 
	locator value should not be duplicate. must be unique
		means, id = "sathya" should be present only once

id 
	* most preferred 
	* do not use if it has numbers in it. 
	* id = "abc123"; - DO NOT USE
		* if we reload again, the id value may change to "abc114"
name
className
	* with more spaces 
tagName
linkText
partialLinkText
CSS selector
xpath -XML path


id, name, className(class) - when these values are unique we can use them directly. 
When they are not unique, we use either xpath or CSS

findElement(By.id(""));
findElement(By.name(""));
findElement(By.class(""));
findElement(By.linkText("selenium"));
findElement(By.linkText("Testing Frameworks"));
findElement(By.linkText("Logging Frameworks"));
findElement(By.parialLinkText("Frameworks"));


	By obj1 = By.className("");
		WebElement ele = driver.findElement(obj1);
		ele.click();
		
		driver.findElement(By.className("")).click();;
		
		driver.findElement(By.id("")).sendKeys();

* when id, name, className attributes are present in an element tag but they not unique, then we go to xpath 
* When id, name, className attributes are not present inside an element's tag, then also we use xpath

&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

CSS Selector

Examples of CSS Selectors
What You Want to Select			CSS Selector Example								Explanation
Element by tag						div											Selects all <div> elements
Element by class					.className									Selects all elements with that class
Element by ID						#elementId									Selects the element with that ID
Nested element						div > span									Selects <span> directly inside <div>
Attribute value						input[name='username']						Input with a name attribute = 'username'
Partial attribute value				a[href*='login']							Link where href contains "login"
Multiple classes					div.class1.class2							Element with both class1 and class2

Window Handling! 

*****************************************************************************

Day 61 (29/05/2024)

Window Handling!  - Class 2

Lets consider 3 window - WinA, WinB, WinC

1. Get window handle of the current window - WinA 
2. do any actions and open many the windows
3. user getWindowHandles() method to get all window handles
4. Remember that, your or your driver's focus is still on WinA, even though you see any other window on your screen.
5. Use for loop or iterator to iterate between the window handles.
6. To switch to each window handle (window) user switchTo().window(winHandle) method
7. Once you switch to a window get its title
8. if the title you get through iteration, matches your expected title then end the for loop.


Case study:
1. Get window handle of the current window - WinA - parent window
2. do any actions and open another the window
3. user getWindowHandles() method to get all window handles
4. Remember that, your or your driver's focus is still on WinA, even though you see any other window on your screen.
5. Use for loop or iterator to iterate between the window handles.
6. if the window handle is not parent window's handle then switch to that window
7. Now you are in the child window
8. use driver.close() and close the child window
9. Now, where my driver's focus will be?

*****************************************************************************

Day 62 (30/05/2024)

Alerts in Selenium

What is alert 
	* Alerts does not let you to proceed with original application unless its been handled.
	* its a pop up ( web based pop up and OS based pop up)

How do you identify whether its a alert or any other normal web page
	* Alert does not let you to proceed with original application
	* Alert does not have any url
	* you can not inspect an alert 

Types:
	* Simple/Informational alert - OK(Accept) button along with some text
	* Prompt alert - Yes(accept) or no(dismiss) alert 
	* Confirmation Alert - You need to enter a text to proceed further 



How to handle an alert:
	* in web page we click a link or button, then it will throw an alert.
	* Web page's focus will be removed 
	* We need to manually switch the focus of the webdriver to the alert
Where the alert is present:
	WebDriver -> TargetLocator switchTo() - Alert alert();
	
	public interface WebDriver {
	
	TargetLocator switchTo();
	
	interface TargetLocator {
		Alert alert()
	}
	
	Alert methods 
	public interface Alert {
  		void dismiss();
 		void accept();
  		String getText();
  		void sendKeys(String keysToSend);
}
	
	}
How do we switch focus to alert 
	1) Alert alt = driver.switchTo().alert();
		alt.dismiss(); or alt.accept();
	2) driver.swithcTo().alert().accept();

Problem we face while working with Alert:- 
	1) We are expecting an alert after clicking an element
		also we write a code to manage the alert
		But sometimes, the alert wont pop up. - Exception:- NoSuchAlertException/NoAlertPresentException
	2) We are not expecting any alert
		But alert pops up - Exception: UnhandledAlertException 
		
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

Drop down handling using Selenium

There are two types 
	* Single selection
	* Multi selection
	
* How Dropdown are configured in a web page
	* By using select tag and options tag
		* index
		* value - attribute
		* display text - attribute
		
	Selenium has a separate class to handle select tag drop down
		* Select class
		* first locate the select  tag - and store it in to Webelement
		* Select select = new Select(WebElement); 
		
Important methods 
	1) selectByIndex(int)
	2) selectByVisibleText(String)
	3) selectByValue(String)
	4) getOptions()
	5) deselectAll() - works only on multiple select 
	6) isMultiple()
	7) selectByContainsVisibleText(String)
	
******** You can also access the drop down with out using Select class***********

In that time you need to use - findElements() method

*****************************************************************************

For the last 4 days 

We practiced writing xpath and creating generic method using amazon website.

Day 63 (05/06/2024)

Frame in selenium

Nested html page available inside original webpage - frame/iframe - tag names

<html>
<body>
<div>
	<ul>
		<li>
		<li>
	</ul>
	<iframe> 
		<html>
		<body>
			<span>
			</span>
		</body>
		</html>
	</iframe>
</div>
</body>
</html>



1) find/locate the desired element
2) Check whether the element is present directly inside html or inside of any iframe/frame
3) if the element is present inside iframe/frame
	a) first locate the iframe/frame element
	b) switch into the iframe/frame --> driver.switchTo().frame(int index);
									-->  driver.switchTo().frame(String frameName);
									-->  driver.switchTo().frame(WebElement ele);
	c) access the element 
	d) to go back to the original html or parent iframe/frame
		--> driver.switchTo().defaultContent();
		

* frames can be nested. Each time you access an element in a frame, you need to switch to it. 	
<html>
	<iframe>
		<div> </div>
		<frame>
				<div></div>
		</frame>
	</iframe>
</html>
				
div - is our element 
	1) from here if you user driver.switchTo().parentFrame(); --> driver focus moves to <iframe>
	2) from here if you user driver.switchTo().defaultContent(); --> driver focus moved to either <iframe> or <html>
	
Exception we encounter while working with frames or iframes
	* NoSuchElementException
	* NoSuchFrameException
	
HOME WORK 
	* Practice frame and nested frames

Actions class in detail

The Actions class in Selenium (often referred to as Actions or Actions Class) is used to handle complex user interactions 
like mouse movements, key presses, click and hold, drag and drop, etc. 


*****************************************************************************
		
Day 65 (09/06/2024)

Robot class in detail

The Robot class in Java (from java.awt.Robot) is often used in Selenium for simulating low-level 
keyboard and mouse interactions that Selenium WebDriver itself cannot handle, such as:

* Handling file upload/download dialogs

* Simulating keyboard presses outside the browser

* Taking full-page screenshots

* Dealing with OS-level pop-ups

*****************************************************************************
		
Day 66 (10/06/2024)

Actions and Robot class revisit

*****************************************************************************
		
Day 67 (12/06/2024)

Casting in Java

Casting in Java refers to converting one data type into another. There are two main types of casting:

1. Primitive Type Casting
	a. Widening Casting (Implicit)
		Automatically done by Java.
		Smaller to larger type conversion.

Examples:
	int a = 10;
	double b = a;  // int to double
	Order:
	byte → short → int → long → float → double

	b. Narrowing Casting (Explicit)
		Manually done using parentheses.
		Larger to smaller type conversion.

Examples:
	double a = 10.5;
	int b = (int) a;  // double to int, value becomes 10


2. Reference Type Casting (Objects)
	Used when dealing with class hierarchies.

	a. Upcasting (Implicit)
		Subclass to superclass.
		Safe and automatic.
Example:
	class Animal {}
	class Dog extends Animal {}
	Animal a = new Dog();  // Upcasting
	
	b. Downcasting (Explicit)
		Superclass to subclass.
		Needs explicit cast and may throw ClassCastException at runtime if types are incompatible.

Example:
	Animal a = new Dog();   // Upcasting
	Dog d = (Dog) a;        // Downcasting
	Important Notes
	Always check with instanceof before downcasting:

		if (a instanceof Dog) {
			Dog d = (Dog) a;
			}
Casting is different from conversion in high-level classes like String → int, which requires parsing (e.g., Integer.parseInt("123")).
  
*****************************************************************************
		
Day 68 (13/06/2024)

Wait in Selenium

In Selenium WebDriver, waits are used to synchronize the execution of test scripts with the web application under test. 
This ensures that Selenium waits for certain conditions before performing actions, 
helping to avoid flaky or failing tests due to timing issues (e.g., elements not being ready).

1. Implicit Wait
	Tells WebDriver to wait a specified amount of time when trying to find an element if it is not immediately available.
	Applies globally to all elements.

Example:
	driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(Duration.ofSeconds(10));
	
2. Explicit Wait
	Waits for a specific condition to occur before proceeding further in the code.
	More powerful and customizable than implicit waits.

Common Conditions (from ExpectedConditions):
	visibilityOfElementLocated
	elementToBeClickable
	presenceOfElementLocated
	alertIsPresent
	titleContains

Example:
	WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, Duration.ofSeconds(10));
	WebElement element = wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.id("username")));
	
3. Fluent Wait
	A more advanced form of explicit wait.
	Allows you to define:
		Polling frequency
		Exceptions to ignore
		Timeout duration

Example:
	Wait<WebDriver> wait = new FluentWait<>(driver)
    	.withTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(30))
    	.pollingEvery(Duration.ofSeconds(5))
    	.ignoring(NoSuchElementException.class);

WebElement element = wait.until(driver -> driver.findElement(By.id("username")));

🧠 When to Use Which?
	Situation	Recommended Wait
	Wait for element load globally	Implicit Wait
	Wait for specific condition	Explicit Wait
	Retry with custom polling and exception handling	Fluent Wait

❌ Avoid This: Thread.sleep()
	Hard-coded wait.
	Always waits full duration, even if condition is met earlier.
	Slows down your test unnecessarily.

✅ Best Practices
	Use explicit waits for dynamic elements.
	Avoid mixing implicit and explicit waits.
	Use FluentWait when polling is required (e.g., waiting for a spinner to disappear).
	
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

Scrolling in Selenium
	* We can not automate scrolling using the selenium
	* sometimes you want to bring an element into the view of your screen to perform operation
		
There are different ways to scroll your application when you work using selenium
	* JavaScriptExecutor (need typecasting)
	* Key board or mouse (Actions or Robot class)
	* Actions class - moveToElement() methods is often used
	
Along with Scrolling, we can also do click and send text to any element using JSE(JavaScriptExecutor).

&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

Screenshot in Selenium

1) using TakesScreenshot interface 
	1. Take Full Page Screenshot
		Best for: capturing the visible part of the page.
	2. Take Screenshot of a Web Element
		Best for: testing visual appearance or layout of individual elements.
2) Take Full Page Screenshot with AShot (3rd-party Library)
3) Robot Class for Web Screenshots

Web table in detail 

How do we work on frame, select, shadow root element 

1) We identity the frame tag (parent tag) and then access the elements present in that tag.
2) We identity the select tag(parent tag) and then accecss the options 
3) We identity the tag (shadow host/parent tag) which contains the shadow root and then we access the element inside the tag.

Like wise,
	We need to identify the tag named <table> and then access the element inside it
	<tr> - table row 
	<th> - table header
	<td> - table data
	
	<table>
		<tr>  - 
			<th>
			<th>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<td>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<td>
			
Questions can be asked in related to web table.
	1) Get/print all table header
	2) print all row values
	3) Print request column's values  
	4) Based on request, fetch/delete/edit/modify the respective row values
	5) Based on one column value, find the respective another column's value
	6) How many rows are in the table including/excluding header row
	
	
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

Shadow root elements

	* If an element is present inside the shadow root, we can not locate it in DOM using xpath or CSS.
		It always shows 0 of 0.
	* To access an element which is present inside the shadow dom or show root. You need to find thet host of the shadow root
		* Then use the method getShadowRoot();
	* Keep in mind that, xpath wond work inside the shadow root. 
		* You need to use the CSS Selector

TestNG

validation in Selenium using TestNG

TestNG is a testing framework inspired from JUnit and NUnit 
but introducing some new functionalities that make it more powerful and easier to use. 
It supports test configured by annotations, data-driven testing, parametric tests, etc.

* To use TestNG methods in your project, you need to add its "dependencies"
* To use TestNG with your eclipse, you need to add its "plug-in" from Eclipse market place

TestNG
* Its a multipurpose tool and also works as a framework
* We can use TestNG as a tool when we use Test Driven or Behaviour Driven frameworks
* TestNG gives you some annotations and tags, so that you can run your test cases easily 
* To work with TestNG in Eclipse, you need to install TestNG Eclipse plugin via market place 
* In order to use TestNG annotations and tags in your project, you need to add TestNG dependencies 

Official Documentation page: https://testng.org/#_testng_documentation

Main annotation of TestNG is @Test 
	* If we run a class using TestNG, then whatever methods represented as @Test will run
	* There are two way to run a class file using TestNG
		1) Simply right click on the class and Run as TestNG 
		2) Right click on the class from project path, Covert the class into TestNG. It will create a xml file. 
			By using the file we can run the class (recommended way)
Whenever we run as TestNG, 
	1) we get a basic report under test-output --> index.html
	2) we also get the recently failed test case details --> emailable-report.html
	3) For recently failed test cases, we get xml in testng-failed.xml



*****************************************************************************
		
Day 70 (16/06/2024)

TestNG provides a default report(index.html) and emailableReport.html.
@Test - estential to run your test case 
Alphabetical order 
To control the order of @Test's, you need to use priority
TestNG xml - how to generate it and how to run from xml
	* Right click the desired class
	* TestNG -> Convert to TestNG
	* xml will be generated
Annotations
	A TestNG test can be configured by @BeforeXXX and @AfterXXX annotations 
	which allows to perform some Java logic before and after a certain point, 
	these points being either of the items listed above.

TestNG assertion

Assertions in Selenium UI testing (with TestNG or any test framework) are essential 
because they validate that the application behaves as expected during or after an interaction. 
Simply put, assertions are what turn your automation scripts into actual tests.

Assertions immediately fail the test if something goes wrong, allowing early detection of bugs.

Without assertions, your Selenium script may:

Click buttons
Fill out fields
Navigate pages

But it doesn't verify if those actions had the correct result.

* Test with assertions = proves the system works
* Test without assertions = just simulates actions

Common TestNG Assertions
	Method	Description
		Assert.assertEquals(actual, expected)	Checks if two values are equal

Framework in Selenium

Difference between Automation and Framework?
* Doing a work without manual effort is called - Automation
	* In Automation - duplicate codes, redundency of codes will be there
	* Explaining the flow is difficult 
	* We can not use it for some other web application
	* To automate each test case, it would take more time because we dont have common or generic methods to reuse.
* Doing a same work by using a properly arranged structure of code.
	E.g: keep a separate class to read or write on excel, prop or config or text files
	
Page Object Model design pattern... 
	* each page - each java class (login page, cart page, payment page)
	* each class - find all the elements inside of it and store it in a variable with proper name. (Page Objects)
	* each class - find all the possible test cases and covert them into methods (Page Objects)
	* how do you differentiate pages in an application - if URL changes, its a new page
	
https://practice.expandtesting.com/
https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/

Different frameworks available
	* Test Driven
	* Data driven Framework
	* Keyword driven Framework
	* Hybrid framework
	
Tools - JUnit, TestNG

Behaviour Driven Framework
	* Cucumber along with JUnit/TestNG
	
When should we Automate
	* Web Application should be stable
	* Manual Test cases available - Manual understanding needed to know the application
	* What are the regression Test cases, in that...
	* In Manual Test cases 
		* What can be automated
		* What can not be automated
		* partially automated 
		* Manual intervention test cases
	* Define Complexity of Test cases 
		* Low 
		* Medium
		* High
	* How much time it would take to complete the entire automation
		
Once we figure out the test cases

1) What technology we are going to use - Java, Python, Selenium, Playwrite, QTP
2) IDE - Eclipse, Visual Studio Code, InteliJ, STS(Spring tool suite)
3) Framework - Data driven, Keyword, Hybrid (Data + keyword + POM + TestNG), Behaviour Driver (Cucumber + TestNG)
4) How do store data - Excel, Json, CSV
5) What are the standards we are going to follow
	* method naming
	* webElement naming

&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

Creating a new framework with TestNG

1) Maven project
2) Add required Dependencies - TestNG, Selenium
	(also add the TestNG library to the project, also add TestNG plugin into Eclipse)
3) Add the drivers
3) Packages creation
		src/main/java
			* Base package
				* Generic Class (We keep all the common methods related to Selenium)
				* Utility Class (File, Excel, prop, text) reading methods
			* Pages package
				* One class for each page
		src/main/resources
			* Files which will be used with src/main/java package classes
		src/test/java
			* TestCases package
				* New hire TCs class, etc
		src/test/resources
			* Files which will be used with src/test/java package classes

Agile



Two kind of methodology
1. Agile
2. Water fall.

Difference between waterfall and agile 

Agile methodology

key words 

Scrum time period or Agile time period  (Iteration)
	- one or two week or 15 days (Mostly its starts on Wednesday and ends with Tuesday)
	
an epic serves to manage tasks. It's a defined body of work that is segmented into specific tasks 
(called �stories,� or �user stories�) based on the needs/requests of customers or end-users


PI meeting - 
	High level team works on who will work on which changes and those changes will be split into small parts so that, 
	we can do that small work in one sprint time
	Duration: 4 hours to half a day 
	Attendee: Product Owner and Scrum master
	
Sprint Planning
	Task(User Stories) for small work is created, explained, assigned to a person, complexity will be decided
	Here complexity is called story point
	Basically story point is fibanocci series 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13.
	
	Inform your leave plan
	 
Daily Stand-Up
	What you did yesterday
	what are you going to do today 
	what is your plan for tomorrow
	Any risk on completing work
	
	leave details for unplanned or planned leave
	
Sprint Review/Demo
	Give prove it or demo on whatever stories you did on that sprint

Sprint Retrospective
	What went well and appreciations
	What need improvement
	
	
When there is a risk in completing a story
	E.g: Developer gives story to testing when there is only 3 days left. But in order to complete the testing you need 7 days
In this case
	1. No other choice you need to complete the testing in 3 days itself.
	2. Complete as much as possible, then create a new QA(Testing) story in next sprint
	3. Move the entire story from this sprint to next sprint
	4. Let your scrum master to ask for extension of the current sprint

Scrum

Teams in Scrum

Company - Wipro
client/Account - Alight
	* One Account can have multiple projects
Domain - Health & Welfare
Project - Bank of America
Project contains many teams and they are called scrum teams (POD)  

Consider client as your project team *****
Each POD is a scrum or agile team

Scrum Team 
	* Scrum Master - POD lead
	* Product Owner - BIM/BOM
	* New hire team config team
	* New hire testing team
	
Scrum team
	Product Owner(PO) - BIM or BOM
	Scrum master - Like lead but does only managerial work
	Devs(Onshore and offshore) - 
	Testers(Onshore and offshore)
	Business Tester if there is any
	
	In my team totally 12 members
	1. PO (client person)
	2. SM (from client or from our company)
	3. 2 dev in onsite (from client or from our company)
	4. 3 dev in offshore (from client or from our company)
	5. 3 Tester in offshore (You and other two) 
	6. 1 Tester in onshore (Testing lead)
	7. Business Tester or BA 
	
Company - Capgemini
Client - Fidelity 
Outsourcing their project to Capgemini
Chennai have fidelity office too. 
Project - Fidelity invesment
Our project have both Client team persons as well as Capgemini team persons

************************************************

Day to day life at work 

When do you automate 

How many test cases do you write on a day
	* where are we with the framework 
	* complexity of the test cases
	
Tell me about yourself
Explain your project 
day to day at office
Tell about your team

****************************************************************************

Agile and Waterfall methodologies


Multiple Agile teams. 

Agile teams & Members

Sprint

Features -> Epics -> Stories

Story - Acceptance Criteria
1) Understanding - purpose of the story, what is expected, which tech
2) Story point - 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 (Anonymous)

Sprint

Sprint ceremonies

PI Planning
	* Client or client's representative explains their initiative or goal or tells the feature they want in their app
	* Product owner, Lead, Scrum master and Tech arch from each agile team will participate
	* Each agile team will be give one or more feature to work on.

* In order to start the sprint, I should know what stories my team need to work before the start of the sprint

How many stories we are going to work
Who is going to work on which story
What the priority
Who is on leave during the sprint/ Any Holidays

Sprint planning - Sprint start 
 * Mostly starts by Wednesday or Thursday
 * Normally two weeks
 * Always happen during the previous print
 * What are the stories are we going to work on this sprint
 * Who is going to work on which story
 * How much story point for each story
 * How many story points we are going to work on this sprint
 
 * Sprint ends on the last day of the Sprint
 
Sprint refinement or backlog refinement
	* Product owner or Dev lead or tech arch, explains each stories in the backlog
	* What is the expectation
	* Defines Acceptance criteria
	* What technologies involved in the story
	* Testing needed or not 

Status Call/Huddle

* What you did yesterday
* Whats your plan for today
* What will you do on tomorrow. 
* Any road blocks you faced/will face to complete the work

Run by - Scrum master
Max time for the meeting - 15 minutes
No technical talks

* Sprint Demo
	* Where all the agile team members participate
	* We need to demonstrate what we worked 
	* Either we need to give demo or show the screenshots(for the time being)
	* Usually given by Product Owner or Lead 
	* Sometimes, tester also need to give

* Sprint Retrospective
	During the last sprint
		* What went well
		* What did not go well
		* What we need to continue doing
		* Appreciation
		* Dependencies from other team went well or not
